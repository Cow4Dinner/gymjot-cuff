# GymJot Cuff - Implementation Summary

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Device Resilience ✅

**Watchdog Timer**
- 30-second timeout protection
- Resets every 5 seconds in main loop
- Automatic recovery from hangs/crashes
- Location: [src/main.cpp:817-819](src/main.cpp#L817-L819), [src/main.cpp:861-864](src/main.cpp#L861-L864)

**Automatic Reconnection**
- Advertising restarts on disconnect
- Retry logic with error handling
- Connection duration tracking
- Location: [src/main.cpp:236-243](src/main.cpp#L236-L243)

**Connection State Management**
- Client connection tracking
- MTU negotiation optimization
- Connection parameter updates for reliability
- Location: [src/main.cpp:69-71](src/main.cpp#L69-L71), [src/main.cpp:191-212](src/main.cpp#L191-L212)

### 2. Comprehensive Diagnostics ✅

**BLE Connection Callbacks** ([src/main.cpp:189-284](src/main.cpp#L189-L284))
- `onConnect`: Logs client address, connection ID, MTU
- `onDisconnect`: Decodes reason codes, shows connection duration
- `onMTUChange`: Reports negotiated MTU
- `onPassKeyRequest`: Displays passkey for pairing
- `onAuthenticationComplete`: Confirms encryption, authentication, bonding
- `onConfirmPIN`: Validates pairing attempts

**Disconnect Reason Decoding**
| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| 0x08 | Connection timeout |
| 0x13 | Remote user terminated |
| 0x16 | Local host terminated |
| 0x3D | Connection failed to establish |
| 0x3E | LMP response timeout |
| 0x22 | LMP error |

**Boot Diagnostics** ([src/main.cpp:804-854](src/main.cpp#L804-L854))
- Firmware version display
- Hardware initialization status
- BLE configuration summary
- Pairing instructions

All UUIDs in one place for easy customization:
```cpp
#define SERVICE_UUID "6E400001-B5A3-F393-E0A9-E50E24DCCA9E"
#define CHAR_RX_UUID "6E400002-B5A3-F393-E0A9-E50E24DCCA9E"

## Cuff-Side Features That Make Mobile Integration Easy

### 1. **Automatic Advertising Management**
```cpp
// On disconnect, automatically restart advertising
NimBLEDevice::startAdvertising();
```
Mobile app doesn't need to tell device to become discoverable - it just is!

### 2. **Connection State Events**
```cpp
// Cuff sends events to confirm connection state
sendEvent("ble-connected");
sendEvent("pairing-success");
sendEvent("ble-disconnected-0xXX");
```
Mobile app can monitor connection health from device's perspective.

### 3. **Improved Notification Reliability**
```cpp
// Don't try to send notifications if no client connected
if (!g_clientConnected) {
    return false;
}
```
Prevents notification failures from cluttering logs.

### 4. **Connection Parameter Optimization**
```cpp
// Request optimal connection parameters for reliability
pServer->updateConnParams(connInfo.getConnHandle(), 12, 24, 0, 400);
```
Better throughput and reduced latency automatically.

### 5. **Comprehensive Error Messages**
```cpp
if (!NimBLEDevice::startAdvertising()) {
    Serial.println("ERROR: Failed to start advertising!");
    Serial.println("TROUBLESHOOTING:");
    Serial.println("  1. Check if BLE is already initialized");
    // ... etc
}
```
Clear guidance when things go wrong.

## Mobile App Implementation Checklist

For an LLM implementing the mobile app, follow this order:

1. **Copy constants** from [QUICKSTART_MOBILE.md](QUICKSTART_MOBILE.md)
2. **Implement scanning** with service UUID filter
3. **Connect with standard GATT callbacks**:
   - onConnectionStateChange → requestMtu(247)
   - onMtuChanged → discoverServices()
   - onServicesDiscovered → enable notifications
4. **Enable notifications** on Event TX and Snapshot characteristics
5. **Parse events**: 2-byte length prefix (little-endian) + protobuf payload
6. **Handle reconnection** with exponential backoff: 1s, 2s, 5s, 10s, 30s
7. **Register bond state receiver** for pairing events
8. **Monitor connection events** from cuff (ble-connected, pairing-success, etc.)

## What the Cuff Does Automatically

✅ **Restarts advertising** on disconnect
✅ **Sends connection state events** for debugging
✅ **Recovers from crashes** via watchdog
✅ **Optimizes connection parameters** for reliability
✅ **Logs everything** to serial for troubleshooting
✅ **Persists device identity** across reboots
✅ **Manages pairing** with secure passkey
✅ **Validates connections** before sending notifications

## What the Mobile App Needs to Do

✅ **Scan** for service UUID
✅ **Connect** with GATT callbacks
✅ **Enable notifications** on Event TX
✅ **Parse length-prefixed** protobuf messages
✅ **Handle reconnection** with exponential backoff
✅ **Register bond state receiver** for pairing
✅ **Show user the passkey** from serial/display

## Testing the Implementation

### On Device (Serial Monitor @ 115200 baud)

1. **Boot:**
   - Verify "BLE ADVERTISING STARTED" appears
   - Note device name and passkey
   - Check all hardware shows "OK"

2. **Connection Attempt:**
   - Watch for "BLE CLIENT CONNECTED"
   - Check client address is logged
   - Verify MTU negotiation

3. **Pairing:**
   - See "PASSKEY REQUESTED"
   - Confirm "PAIRING SUCCESSFUL"
   - Check encryption/bonding status

4. **Disconnection:**
   - Note reason code and description
   - Verify "Restarting advertising...OK"
   - Check connection duration

### On Mobile App

1. **Scan:**
   - Find devices with service UUID
   - Filter by "cuff-" name prefix
   - Extract device ID from manufacturer data

2. **Connect:**
   - Bond with passkey from serial
   - Verify MTU set to 247
   - Confirm service discovery

3. **Receive Events:**
   - Get "ble-connected" status event
   - Receive boot event
   - Parse snapshot updates

4. **Disconnect/Reconnect:**
   - Clean disconnect works
   - Auto-reconnect after signal loss
   - Exponential backoff prevents spam

## Performance Characteristics

| Metric | Value | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Advertising Interval | 100-200ms | Fast discovery |
| MTU | 247 bytes | Optimal for protobuf messages |
| TX Power | -12 dBm | Reduced interference |
| Connection Interval | 15-30ms | Optimized for reliability |
| Watchdog Timeout | 30s | Recovery from hangs |
| Watchdog Reset | 5s | Frequent health checks |
| Snapshot Update | 2s | Periodic state sync |

## Security

- ✅ **Authentication required** - Device must be paired
- ✅ **Bonding required** - Pairing info stored
- ✅ **Encryption required** - All characteristics encrypted
- ✅ **Secure passkey** - Random 6-digit PIN
- ✅ **Persistent identity** - Same passkey across reboots
- ✅ **IO capability: NoInputNoOutput** - Standard for embedded devices

## Known Limitations

1. **Passkey Display**: Currently only on serial monitor
   - Future: Add OLED display support

2. **Single Connection**: Device supports one client at a time
   - This is intentional for security
   - Clear "already connected" state

3. **OTA Not Implemented**: Placeholder only
   - Future feature
   - Commands return error

## Future Enhancements

1. **OLED Display**
   - Show passkey on device
   - Display connection status
   - Show current rep count

2. **Multi-Device Support**
   - Allow multiple cuffs per phone
   - Device pairing management
   - Simultaneous connections

3. **Over-the-Air Updates**
   - Implement OTA characteristic functionality
   - Firmware update via BLE
   - Checksum verification

4. **Connection Quality Metrics**
   - RSSI monitoring
   - Packet loss tracking
